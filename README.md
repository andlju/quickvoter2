Knockout and SignalR demo
=========================

This is the code for a demo I've been doing on Knockout.js and SignalR. 

The demo starts out with the starting-point branch and usually ends up with something similar to the code in the master branch.

More information about the products used in the demo can be found here:

NancyFX

A really nice light-weight web framework for .NET

KnockoutJS
----------

Data binding library for doing Model-View-ViewModel style binding in JavaScript. They have a really nice set of tutorials and documentation so go have a look at those!

SignalR
--------
http://asp.net/signalr

Real-time communication library for ASP.NET to add that magic touch of pushing data from the server to the client.
